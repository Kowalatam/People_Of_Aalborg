					    <p class="card-text">I was given the opportunity to open up and not be within the setting of the Municipality but a more open one, where we could invite not just refugees but also internationals. So, we had half a year trial period with mainly free events, twice a week, with coffees and teas and again we just saw people are coming... And every time somebody came, the next time he would bring someone else, so it just kept on growing and evolving. A lot of the people here in the Café are away from their family. And we try to be a place where they feel welcomed and at home and can relax and be themselves.</p>

					    <p class="card-text">The genocide in Rwanda, the civil war in former Yugoslavia, those were horrible human rights abuses that caught my attention. And I wanted to do something about that, about those situations, and that is how I got involved and soon I discovered that they are many issues relating to human rights and I wanted to make a difference. And I think that in Amnesty International it is possible to make a difference, we do make a difference and we have made a difference and we continue to make a difference.</p>

					    <p class="card-text">Students usually come with issues regarding their studies or exams, stress or anxiety, and also quite private topics like relationships with family or friends; many students experience loneliness or difficulties in their relationships. Foreign students are often quite far away from their friends and family, which can be upsetting… They can always call or send an email. Everyone can reach us at praesten@adm.aau.dk.</p>

					    <p class="card-text">I think it is important to take action while you are young. Be politically active and help make a change. We are the next generation to “take over the world”. They say that the current generation is actually the last generation to be able to save the world: we are just taking the scraps and putting them back together. This is why it is so important that everyone acts, everyone needs to do something, because if we don’t — well the outcome will not be all that great... I don’t know how to fix global poverty, but I know how to recycle, and I know how to donate to Red Cross.</p>
